* Epics Alarms
<2023-07-07 Fri> Brendan Chandler

Many epics records have alarm fields which cause the record to go into
an "alarm" mode when the record's value exceeds some threshold.
Different records can have different alarm fields.

For ai, ao, longin, longout, and calc; these fields set values for when the alarm is triggered:
- HIHI
- HIGH
- LOW
- LOLO

These fields determine how severe the alarm is, when one of the above is triggered:
- HHSV (matches HIHI)
- HSV  (matches HIGH)
- LSV  (matches LOW)
- LLSV (matches LOLO)
  
They can be values such as NO_ALARM, MINOR, or MAJOR.

A minor alarm might typically show up as yellow, where a major alarm
might show up as red.  To set alarms in an MEDM screen, configure a UI
element's "color mode" to be set to "alarm"

In the example above, the box will be green normally, but turn yellow
for a MINOR alarm and red for a MAJOR alarm.

The database record might look like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
record(calc, "$(P):CapOT_M") {
	field(INPA, "$(P):FaultsStatusM")
	field(CALC, "(A >> 1) & 1")
	field(FLNK, "$(P):HeatSinkOT_M")
	field(HIHI, "0.5")
	field(HHSV, "MAJOR")
}
#+END_EXAMPLE

In this case, the alarm would go off for any value over 0.5 and it
would be a MAJOR alarm.  For the MEDM screen, the box will be green
for a value of 0, and turn red for a value of 1.

Note also, that if you have a BI or BO record, the fields change:
- ZSV -- alarm severity if value is 0 (NO_ALARM, MINOR, MAJOR)
- OSV -- alarm severity if value is 1
